        <p>Mini-Baccarat is a smaller, lower-stakes version of Punto banco Baccarat. 
        Mini-Baccarat is different in that it is generally lower limits than baccarat. 
        It is also different in that the player does not get to pick up the cards, 
        and the fact that the table is smaller in size. Mini-Baccarat is popular in many 
        casinos, especially among Asian gamblers</p>
       
       <p>Like Baccarat, Mini-Baccarat is a comparing card game played between two hands, 
       the "player" and the "banker". Each baccarat coup has three possible outcomes: "player" (player has the higher score), "
       banker" (banker has the high score), and "tie". It is strictly a game of chance, 
       with no skill or strategy involved; each player's moves are forced by the cards the player is dealt.</p>
    
        <p>The winning hand is the one with a total of 9 or as close to 9 as possible. The following chart explains what happens after you've bet on the Player or Banker and each participant has been dealt two cards. It's not necessary to memorize the chart since your decisions in this game are limited. All you do is make the bet. It's a good idea, though, to look it over so you know why you're winning or not. It's also important to remember that when the Banker or Player must draw, only one card is being drawn. In other words, the most cards any Player or Banker will have are three.</p>

      <p>
Pull up a chair and place your bet on either the section labeled Player or the section labeled Banker (dealer). You could also bet on Tie, but the odds are slim that a tie will occur, so just focus on the Player bet or the Banker bet.

That's it. You're done. Once you've made your bet, your decision-making is complete. Now, watch the money accumulate or disappear. OK, you probably want to know why your money is coming or going.</p>

    <h3>Let Us teach you Mini-Baccarat!</h3>
    <p>First of all, the main difference between Baccarat and Mini-Baccarat is that with the former, the Players alternate being the Banker by passing the shoe (the container holding the cards) and with the latter, the dealer is always the Banker and the Players never touch the cards. Being the Banker in Baccarat may be intimidating at first, but there are Callers at the table to assist you. The rest of the rules apply to both versions.</p>

    <p>Since it has been proven that the Banker's hand wins more than the Player's hand, the casino collects a 5 percent commission when a bet is placed on the Banker and the Banker's hand wins. However, if a bet was placed on the Player and the Player's hand wins, no commission is required. The dealer collects the commissions; so don't worry about bringing a calculator. In the event of a tie and no one bet on Tie, the hand is considered a push and no one wins or loses.</p>
